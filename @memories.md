# NovaSanctum Memories

Updated: 2026-02-07

## Institutional Identity

1. NovaSanctum is an MK Worldwide nonprofit program focused on open learning pathways.
2. The program curates free, public educational resources and organizes them into structured progression routes.
3. AI is assistive only and never presented as instructional authority.

## Program Guardrails

1. Do not position NovaSanctum as replacing universities or accredited education.
2. Do not claim ownership of third-party educational content.
3. Keep public language grant-legible, institutionally neutral, and auditable.
4. Keep GameDin as related outreach/community infrastructure, not the institutional face.

## Alignment Progress to Date

1. Stage 1 completed: public mission reset and removal of off-mission route surfaces.
2. De-bloat pass completed: tests and speculative documentation removed from primary surface.
3. Current phase: Phase 3 repository minimization and institutional baseline hardening.

## Current Runtime Surface

1. `/` home
2. `/dashboard` program status
3. `/search` resource navigator
4. `/api/search` federated resource search endpoint

## Operating Principle

Build incrementally, document decisions, and prefer durable institutional clarity over speculative scope.
