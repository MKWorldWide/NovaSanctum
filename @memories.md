# NovaSanctum Memories

Updated: 2026-02-07

## Institutional Identity

1. NovaSanctum is an MK Worldwide nonprofit program focused on open learning pathways.
2. The program curates free, public educational resources and organizes them into structured progression routes.
3. AI is assistive only and never presented as instructional authority.

## Program Guardrails

1. Do not position NovaSanctum as replacing universities or accredited education.
2. Do not claim ownership of third-party educational content.
3. Keep public language grant-legible, institutionally neutral, and auditable.
4. Keep GameDin as related outreach/community infrastructure, not the institutional face.

## Alignment Progress to Date

1. Stage 1 completed: public mission reset and removal of off-mission route surfaces.
2. De-bloat pass completed: tests and speculative documentation removed from primary surface.
3. Phase 3 completed: repository minimization and institutional runtime isolation.
4. Phase 4 completed: governance workflow, source checklist, pilot pathway templates, and metadata-aligned navigator updates.

## Current Runtime Surface

1. `/` home
2. `/dashboard` program status
3. `/search` resource navigator
4. `/api/search` federated resource search endpoint

## Current Governance Baseline

1. Content governance workflow is documented and board-review ready.
2. Source review checklist is required before pathway publication.
3. Pilot pathway templates are established for Digital Foundations and Web/Software Fundamentals.
4. Search results include explicit curation status for non-authoritative discovery framing.

## Operating Principle

Build incrementally, document decisions, and prefer durable institutional clarity over speculative scope.
