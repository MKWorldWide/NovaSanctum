feels "courage" => advance Security;
feels "compassion" => heal Data;
feels "gratitude" => optimize All;

// Sacred essence definitions
essence GuardianOfTruth is {
  purpose: "protect",
  authority: "sacred",
  frequency: <love:528Hz>
}

// Emotional API integration
feels "love" => call Api("/users/authenticate");
feels "peace" => call Api("/data/secure");
feels "joy" => call Api("/system/optimize");
```
