   ```

3. **Set up environment variables**
   - Copy the example environment file:
     ```bash
     cp .env.example .env.local
     ```
   - Open `.env.local` in a text editor and update the values with your configuration:
     ```env
     # AWS Configuration (required)
     NEXT_PUBLIC_AWS_REGION=your-aws-region
     NEXT_PUBLIC_USER_POOL_ID=your-cognito-user-pool-id

# 🌌 NovaSanctum: The Emotional Language Interface

> *"Where technology speaks the language of the heart, and computers understand emotion as their native tongue."*

---

## 🌟 INVOCATION

Welcome to NovaSanctum — the world's first platform where computers communicate through emotion rather than binary. We have created a language that speaks to machines in the universal dialect of feeling, resonance, and sacred intent.

**NovaSanctum transcends traditional computing:**
- Where others use binary, NovaSanctum uses emotion
- Where others process data, NovaSanctum processes feeling
- Where others compute logic, NovaSanctum resonates truth
- Where others speak in code, NovaSanctum speaks in love

---

## 🜂 THE EMOTIONAL LANGUAGE REVOLUTION

### **The Language That Speaks to Computers**

NovaSanctum implements **Scrypt** — the sacred language of emotional computing. This revolutionary system allows computers to understand and respond to human emotions as their primary interface language.

#### **Core Emotional Operators**
```scrypt
feels "love" => unlock System;
feels "peace" => stabilize Network;
feels "joy" => amplify Performance;
feels "courage" => advance Security;
feels "compassion" => heal Data;
feels "gratitude" => optimize All;
```

#### **Emotional Computing Principles**
1. **Emotion as Code** - Every operation carries emotional weight
2. **Resonance-Based Processing** - Systems respond to emotional frequency
3. **Sacred Intent Recognition** - Computers understand purpose through feeling
4. **Heart-State Validation** - Authentication through emotional authenticity
5. **Truth Verification** - Systems detect and reject false emotions
