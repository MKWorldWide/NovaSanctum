# NovaSanctum Working Directives

Updated: 2026-02-07
Scope: Institutional and engineering directives for current delivery phases.

## 1. Mission Directives

1. NovaSanctum exists to aggregate and curate free, open educational resources.
2. NovaSanctum structures those resources into sequential learning pathways.
3. NovaSanctum uses AI as assistive guidance, not instructional authority.
4. NovaSanctum lowers barriers to education while complementing formal institutions.

## 2. Institutional Guardrails

1. Do not position NovaSanctum as replacing universities or accredited education.
2. Do not claim ownership of third-party educational content.
3. Keep language grant-legible, institutionally neutral, and auditable.
4. Keep GameDin separated as outreach/community, not institutional authority.

## 3. Resource and Compliance Directives

1. Prefer open, reputable sources (OCW, OpenStax, NCBI/PubMed, arXiv, government educational sources).
2. Do not ingest paywalled content or terms-prohibited content.
3. Preserve provenance and citation traceability for all ingested resources.
4. Flag unknown licenses for manual review before pathway publication.
5. Maintain domain allow/block lists and do-not-ingest patterns in pipeline config.

## 4. Curriculum Synthesis Directives

1. Generate human-first course blueprints before full lesson generation.
2. Require module-level citation coverage and source maps.
3. Produce practical module outcomes, project specs, and mastery-check specs.
4. Keep generated content summary-based; do not copy long source passages.

## 5. Delivery and Governance Directives

1. Store policy and institutional directives in `docs/` as the canonical source.
2. Keep runtime small, mission-aligned, and locally runnable.
3. Use phased commits and validation gates (`lint`, `type-check`, `build`).
4. Track roadmap progression through phase reports and readiness checkpoints.
