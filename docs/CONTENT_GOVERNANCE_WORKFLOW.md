# NovaSanctum Content Governance Workflow

Effective date: 2026-02-07

## 1. Purpose

Define the end-to-end workflow for adding, reviewing, approving, and maintaining pathway content and curated resources in NovaSanctum.

## 2. Roles

1. Program Lead: accountable owner for mission alignment and institutional positioning.
2. Curation Lead: responsible for resource quality, attribution completeness, and pathway structure.
3. Policy Reviewer: checks AI, licensing, and separation-of-concerns compliance.
4. Governance Reviewer (board delegate): approves publication of significant pathway or policy updates.

## 3. Workflow Stages

1. Intake
   - Inputs: pathway proposal, resource candidates, intended outcomes.
   - Output: intake record with domain, level, and scope.
2. Triage
   - Confirm mission fit and determine whether request is pathway, policy, or maintenance.
   - Reject or defer off-mission or unverifiable content.
3. Curation Review
   - Evaluate each source with `/Users/sovereign/Projects/NovaSanctum/docs/SOURCE_REVIEW_CHECKLIST.md`.
   - Require attribution and licensing fields before promotion to pathway draft.
4. Policy Review
   - Verify AI assistance framing, institutional language, and GameDin separation compliance.
5. Governance Decision
   - Governance Reviewer marks decision: approve, approve-with-conditions, or reject.
   - Record rationale and required follow-up actions.
6. Publication
   - Publish approved updates to mission-aligned docs and runtime surfaces.
   - Mark reviewed resources as `curationStatus: reviewed` where applicable.
7. Maintenance
   - Recheck links, currency, and relevance on a recurring cycle.
   - Escalate broken, outdated, or noncompliant resources for correction.

## 4. Decision Cadence

1. Operational curation review: weekly.
2. Governance approval review: monthly, or ad hoc for urgent corrections.
3. Full policy review: quarterly during active development; annually after stabilization.

## 5. Required Records

1. Intake log entry.
2. Checklist evidence for each resource.
3. Governance decision log with approver and date.
4. Publication/change log with affected files and rationale.

## 6. Escalation Rules

1. Any licensing ambiguity blocks publication.
2. Any claim lacking attributable source is removed or rewritten.
3. Any AI output presented as final authority triggers correction and review.
