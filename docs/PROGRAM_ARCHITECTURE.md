Effective date: 2026-02-07  
Program: NovaSanctum

## 1. Program Structure

NovaSanctum is organized into four operational layers:

1. Resource curation
2. Learning pathways
3. AI learner assistance
4. Governance and integrity

## 2. Initial Learning Domains

Phase 1 domains:

1. Digital foundations
2. Web and software fundamentals
3. Data literacy
4. AI literacy and responsible use
5. Career readiness for self-directed learners

## 3. Pathway Blueprint

Each pathway follows the same structure:

1. Entry: prerequisites and orientation
2. Foundation: core concepts and source set
3. Progression: intermediate modules and milestone tasks
4. Applied outcomes: portfolio or practical artifacts
5. Transition: next pathways or external credential bridges

## 4. Resource Metadata Standard

All curated resources should include:

1. Title
2. Source or publisher
3. URL
4. License or usage terms
5. Domain
6. Level
7. Estimated learning time
8. Prerequisites
9. Last review date

## 5. AI Assistance in the Pathway

AI can:

1. Explain source material in plain language
2. Recommend next steps based on progress
3. Suggest pacing and review plans
4. Support learner reflection and checkpoints

AI cannot:

1. Act as instructor of record
2. Issue grades or credentials
3. Replace source attribution or cited materials

## 6. Program Outcome Tracking

Track outcomes with practical, reviewable indicators:

1. Resource coverage by domain
2. Pathway completion rates
3. Milestone completion rates
4. Learner progression between pathway levels
5. Source quality and link integrity checks
