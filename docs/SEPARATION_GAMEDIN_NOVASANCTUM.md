NovaSanctum is the institutional face for:

GameDin may operate as:

3. Optional ecosystem connector outside the core learning institution

## 4. Boundary Rules

1. NovaSanctum public educational pages must not depend on GameDin runtime services.
2. NovaSanctum mission and policy pages must not use GameDin branding as institutional authority.
3. GameDin references inside NovaSanctum must be labeled as related initiatives only.
4. Institutional reporting, grant documentation, and educational outcomes are published under NovaSanctum only.

## 5. Governance

Any new integration point between the two systems requires:

2. Data and privacy review
3. Public communication review
4. Approval by program governance owner
