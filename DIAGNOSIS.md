## Repository Overview
- **Project Name**: NovaSanctum
- **Primary Language**: TypeScript/JavaScript (Node.js)
- **Framework**: Next.js 14
- **UI**: React 18 with Tailwind CSS
- **Testing**: Jest, Testing Library
- **Linting/Formatting**: ESLint, Prettier
- **Package Manager**: npm (with package-lock.json)
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions
- **Infrastructure**: AWS Amplify

## Current Issues

### 1. CI/CD Pipeline
- ❌ Using Node.js 18.x (should be updated to 20.x LTS)
- ❌ No caching for npm dependencies in build job
- ❌ No concurrency control for CI runs
- ❌ No matrix testing across different environments
- ❌ No artifact retention for test results
- ❌ Missing security scanning

### 2. Documentation
- ❌ README.md needs modernization and better structure
- ❌ Missing CONTRIBUTING.md with development guidelines
- ❌ No CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md (though referenced in root)
- ❌ No SECURITY.md (though referenced in root)

### 3. Testing
- ❌ No test coverage reporting in CI
- ❌ No end-to-end testing
- ❌ Missing test result visualization

### 4. Dependencies
- ❌ Multiple dev dependencies could be updated
- ❌ No dependency update automation (e.g., Dependabot)
- ❌ Missing .nvmrc for consistent Node versioning

## Improvement Plan

### Phase 1: CI/CD Modernization
- [ ] Update Node.js to 20.x LTS
- [ ] Add proper caching for npm dependencies
- [ ] Implement concurrency controls
- [ ] Add security scanning (dependabot, code scanning)
- [ ] Add test coverage reporting

### Phase 2: Documentation
- [ ] Modernize README.md with:
  - Badges for build status, coverage, etc.
  - Clear setup instructions
  - Development workflow
  - Contribution guidelines
- [ ] Add/update CONTRIBUTING.md
- [ ] Add/update SECURITY.md
- [ ] Add GitHub Pages documentation site

### Phase 3: Testing Enhancements
- [ ] Add test coverage reporting
- [ ] Set up end-to-end testing
- [ ] Add test result visualization

### Phase 4: Developer Experience
- [ ] Add .nvmrc for Node version management
- [ ] Set up pre-commit hooks with Husky
- [ ] Add commit message linting
- [ ] Add PR templates

## Implementation Notes
- All changes will be backward compatible
- Changes will be made in a dedicated branch
- Each improvement will be a separate commit
- Comprehensive testing will be performed before merging

## Success Metrics
- ✅ Faster CI build times (target: < 5 minutes)
- ✅ 100% test coverage of critical paths
- ✅ Clear, up-to-date documentation
- ✅ Automated dependency updates
- ✅ Consistent development environment

## Next Steps
1. Review and approve this diagnosis
2. Create implementation plan for Phase 1
3. Proceed with CI/CD modernization
4. Move to subsequent phases upon completion
