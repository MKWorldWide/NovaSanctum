## Active Phase

Phase 3: Repository minimization and pathway implementation setup.

## Current Work Queue

1. Build first two pathway templates using `docs/PROGRAM_ARCHITECTURE.md`.
2. Define source review checklist for quality, access, and licensing.
3. Add pathway outcome tracking schema (milestones, completion, transition).
4. Draft board-facing governance workflow for content approval cycles.

## Engineering Backlog (Mission-Aligned)

1. Normalize search scoring for learning relevance.
2. Add source metadata badges (license, level, last review date).
3. Add lightweight analytics for pathway progression metrics.
4. Remove or isolate unused legacy components from runtime bundles.

## Validation Checklist

1. `npm run lint`
2. `npm run type-check`
3. `npm run build`

## Notes

Prioritize changes that improve institutional clarity and learner utility in the same increment.
