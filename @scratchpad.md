## Active Phase

Phase 5: Pathway population, governance execution evidence, and impact metrics wiring.

## Current Work Queue

1. Populate pilot pathway templates with vetted resources that pass source review.
2. Run first governance review cycle and record approval artifacts.
3. Add dashboard-level metrics for pathway starts, progression, and completion.
4. Introduce periodic link integrity checks for curated resources.

## Engineering Backlog (Mission-Aligned)

1. Normalize search scoring for learning relevance.
2. Add reviewed-resource promotion path (`automated-discovery` to `reviewed`).
3. Add lightweight analytics for pathway progression metrics.
4. Add curation maintenance jobs for link and metadata health.

## Validation Checklist

1. `npm run lint`
2. `npm run type-check`
3. `npm run build`

## Notes

Prioritize changes that improve institutional clarity and learner utility in the same increment.
